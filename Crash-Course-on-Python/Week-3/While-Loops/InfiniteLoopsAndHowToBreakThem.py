# Question
# The following code causes an infinite loop. Can you figure out what’s missing and how to fix it?
def print_range(start, end):
	# Loop through the numbers from start to end
	n = start
	while n <= end:
		print(n)
		n += 1

print_range(1, 5)  # Should print 1 2 3 4 5 (each number on its own line)
